# Project 3. MIPS Pipelined Simulator
Skeleton developed by CMU,
modified for KAIST CS311 purpose by THKIM, BKKIM and SHJEON.

## Instructions
There are three files you may modify: `util.h`, `run.h`, and `run.c`.

### 1. util.h

We have setup the basic CPU\_State that is sufficient to implement the project.
However, you may decide to add more variables, and modify/remove any misleading variables.

### 2. run.h

You may add any additional functions that will be called by your implementation of `process_instruction()`.
In fact, we encourage you to split your implementation of `process_instruction()` into many other helping functions.
You may decide to have functions for each stages of the pipeline.
Function(s) to handle flushes (adding bubbles into the pipeline), etc.

### 3. run.c

**Implement** the following function:

    void process_instruction()

The `process_instruction()` function is used by the `cycle()` function to simulate a `cycle` of the pipelined simulator.
Each `cycle()` the pipeline will advance to the next instruction (if there are no stalls/hazards, etc.).
Your internal register, memory, and pipeline register state should be updated according to the instruction
that is being executed at each stage.

### Added registers

For each pipeline registers, I created 2 states : past and new, so that there is no synchronization issue. The new registers will be updated using the past registers, and after all the stages are executed once, the past registers will contain the new values for the next cycle.

Starting from ID/EX pipeline, all the following pipelines contain control signals, like EX_control_signals, MEM_control_signals, WB_control_signals, each corresponding to the control signals that are used in that stage. 

I didn't use all the given registers, but used most of them.
